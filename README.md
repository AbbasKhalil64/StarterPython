# StarterPython

This is meant to test different python concepts and file access. file ingestion, and print dump to a file as a log per instance of a code Run.

It took a while to manipulate the list of dictionaries to eventually load to a Numpy Array. In the process, I came to appreciate how fast
the data can be loaded in SQLite3 in comparison to the much slower ingestion when done in Numpy. I will further refine the code to do a chunk
insertion, as I need to explore Numpy more.
